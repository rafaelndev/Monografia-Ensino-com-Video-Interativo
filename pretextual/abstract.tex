 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
Technological resources are increasingly present in schools, for being very important to the construction of critical thinking, social and human, however, using them in school is a major challenge for many teachers. The objective of this work is to develop a educational tool that assists the teacher in the use of videos in Distance Education, allowing the construction of courses with questionnaires associated with videos integrated into learning management systems like Moodle through the Learning Tool Interoperability. In order to get this goal, PHP was used through the laravel framework In addition to Javascript with Vue.JS and jQuery libraries. A LTI library developed in PHP was used but needed to be updated to meet the requirements of development.
